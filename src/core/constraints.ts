/**
 * MinimalCAD Web

 *
 * Ported from constraints.py: one-shot distance-constraint solver backing
 * commands/constrainDistance.ts.
 *
 * Scope: a "driven" point feature (a Circle/Arc/Ellipse center, or a Line's
 * start/end/midpoint) can be positioned by one or more distance constraints
 * against "reference" features (another such point, or a Line's own
 * infinite edge). This is NOT a persistent/live parametric link -- solving
 * happens once, at the moment a constraint is added, using the driven
 * point's current position as the seed. Later edits to a reference entity
 * do not retroactively re-solve anything.
 *
 * Not a general 2D sketch solver: only the driven point's own two
 * coordinates are unknowns. Every reference is treated as fixed for the
 * duration of the solve, and only one point moves per solve.
 *
 * Constraints are stored as plain objects in Document.constraints (the
 * same passthrough array every other part of this app already round-trips
 * opaquely) -- this module is what first gives that array real meaning.
