/**
 * MinimalCAD Web
 * commands/explode.ts
 *
 * Ported from commands/explode.py: breaks a composite entity down into its
 * constituent primitives -- Polyline into its own Line/Arc segments
 * (Polyline.segmentEntities(), the same per-edge reconstruction its own
 * draw() already uses), Dimension into the Line/Arc/Text primitives its
 * draw() calls already amount to (Dimension.explode(), the same machinery
 * io/dxf.ts's DXF export uses to give a Dimension a flat primitive form).
 * Anything else (Line, Arc, Circle, Ellipse, Text) is already a primitive
 * -- EXPLODE leaves it untouched. No Table in this web port yet (see
 * entities/registry.ts), so it isn't in EXPLODABLE_TYPES here either.
 *
 * Two ways to invoke it, mirroring JOIN's own two entry points: pre-select
 * one or more Polylines/Dimensions before running EXPLODE to break every
 * one apart immediately as a single undo step, or (nothing pre-selected)
 * click one at a time, looping to explode more without re-running the tool.
