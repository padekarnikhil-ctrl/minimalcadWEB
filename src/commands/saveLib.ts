/**
 * MinimalCAD Web
 * commands/saveLib.ts
 *
 * Ported from commands/save_library.py: type a name, save the current
 * selection (or the whole drawing if nothing is selected) as a reusable
 * part. No Table in this web port yet, so nothing library-specific to
 * preview while active -- matches the desktop source, which has no
 * draw()/preview override either.
 *
 * Storage differs from the desktop app: parts live as rows in Supabase's
 * `parts` table (io/cloudParts.ts, supabase/migrations/0003_parts.sql)
 * instead of standalone .jcad files in a filesystem folder, since the
 * browser has no filesystem and this app supports multiple accounts. A
 * per-owner unique name constraint reproduces the desktop app's refusal to
 * silently overwrite an existing part name -- surfaced here as the same
 * friendly "already exists" error io/cloudParts.ts already translates it
 * to, rather than a separate pre-check against a fetched name list (the
 * database is the single source of truth either way, so a second local
 * check would just be a race-prone, purely cosmetic duplicate of it).
 *
 * @supabase/supabase-js is NEVER statically imported here -- commands/
 * registry.ts (and everything it imports) is part of the always-loaded
 * main bundle, constructed eagerly for every command at startup (see
 * commands/manager.ts), so pulling that dependency in at module scope
 * would defeat ui/cloudPanel.ts's whole reason for existing (see its own
 * header comment). io/cloudParts.ts is loaded via a dynamic import()
 * instead, only once this command actually runs -- Vite/Rollup code-splits
 * it into the same lazily-loaded chunk ui/cloudPanelImpl.ts already uses.
