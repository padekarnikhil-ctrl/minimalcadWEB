/**
 * MinimalCAD Web
 * commands/constrainDistance.ts
 *
 * Ported from commands/constrain_distance.py: one-click "constrain from a
 * reference" workflow driving core/constraints.ts's one-shot distance
 * solver -- pick the entity to position (its point feature becomes the
 * thing being solved for), pick a reference entity (a Line's own edge, or
 * another entity's center), type the target distance. Repeat picking more
 * references against the SAME driven entity to fully locate it (e.g. two
 * perpendicular rectangle sides), or right-click (BaseCommand's default)
 * to stop and re-run the command for a different entity.
 *
 * Solving re-runs ALL of the driven entity's constraints together every
 * time a new one is added (not just the newest), so two references land
 * the point at their exact intersection rather than sequentially, and a
 * distance that would be geometrically incompatible with what's already
 * there is rejected outright instead of silently landing somewhere wrong
 * -- see core/constraints.ts's solvePoint() residual check.
