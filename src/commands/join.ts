 * commands/join.ts
 *
 * Ported from commands/join.py. Merges entities in two different ways,
 * tried in this order:
 *   1. Primitive merge: colinear Line segments (even with a gap or an
 *      overlap) collapse into a single Line; Arc segments sharing the same
 *      center and radius collapse into a single Arc, or a Circle if their
 *      combined sweep closes the full 360.
 *   2. Connect: anything else that shares a coincident endpoint -- a Line
 *      and an Arc meeting at an angle, two Arcs on different circles, a
 *      Line onto an already-joined Polyline, etc. -- is strung together
 *      into a single Polyline, the same way AutoCAD's JOIN turns a
 *      connected-but-not-colinear chain of objects into one polyline. If
 *      the chain loops back to its own start, the result is a closed
 *      Polyline.
 *
 * Two ways to invoke it:
 *   1. Pre-select two or more Line/Arc/Polyline entities before running
 *      JOIN -- every joinable/connectable pair in the selection is merged
 *      immediately, repeatedly (so a whole connected chain -- even a
 *      closed outline made of several different entity types -- collapses
 *      in a single run), as one undo step.
 *   2. With nothing pre-selected, click a first Line/Arc/Polyline, then a
 *      second -- mirrors commands/fillet.ts's pick-first/pick-second state
 *      machine, minus the corner math.
 *
 * In bulk mode, connect-merging is refused through any point where a third
 * entity in the selection also meets (an ambiguous T/Y-junction) -- same as
 * AutoCAD, and the same degree-2-only rule io/dxf.ts already applies before
 * it will walk a chain into a closed loop for export. A colinear primitive
 * merge is exempt from this check since two segments running straight
 * through a point stay unambiguous regardless of what else touches that
 * same point.
 *
 * Bulk mode also refuses to *bridge a real gap* between two colinear lines
 * when either facing end is already claimed by other connected geometry in
 * the selection -- e.g. two colinear edges of an outline with a
 * tab/bracket detour physically wired in between them. Interactive
 * click-click JOIN is exempt (a gap is always bridged there) since the
 * user explicitly picked those two exact lines.
