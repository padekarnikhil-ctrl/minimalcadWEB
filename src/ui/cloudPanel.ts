/**
 * MinimalCAD Web
 * ui/cloudPanel.ts
 *
 * Thin, always-statically-imported shim in front of ui/cloudPanelImpl.ts --
 * see that module's header comment for the full reason (bundle size for
 * users who never touch cloud features, and a Rollup tree-shaking
 * correctness issue triggered by @supabase/supabase-js's dependency graph
 * being reachable from the same chunk as unrelated toolbar.ts code).
 *
 * Deliberately duplicates the tiny "is Supabase configured" check from
 * lib/supabaseClient.ts rather than importing it from there: importing
 * anything from that module -- even just this one boolean helper -- would
 * statically pull in its `import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js"`
 * line too, defeating the point of this split. Two lines of duplication is
 * cheaper than depending on tree-shaking to prune it back out, especially
 * given the tree-shaking bug this split exists to route around.
