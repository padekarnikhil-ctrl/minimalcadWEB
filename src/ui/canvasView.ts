/**
 * MinimalCAD Web
 * ui/canvasView.ts
 *
 * Owns the <canvas> element: HiDPI-correct backing-store sizing, the
 * pan/zoom/grid/entity/selection/command-preview render pass, and
 * dispatches pointer/keyboard events (converted to world coordinates) into
 * the Engine -- the direct analogue of graphics/canvas.py's
 * mousePressEvent/mouseMoveEvent/wheelEvent/keyPressEvent.
 *
 * HiDPI note: viewport.zoom/panOffset and every pointer-event coordinate stay
 * in CSS-pixel space throughout. devicePixelRatio only ever enters the
 * picture via the one-time backing-store resize and the per-frame
 * ctx.scale(dpr, dpr) below -- mixing CSS-pixel and device-pixel coordinates
 * anywhere else would silently break picking/pan/zoom.
 *
 * Touch/pointer note: this listens for Pointer Events (not separate mouse/
 * touch listeners), which mouse, pen, and touch input all dispatch alike --
 * `e.pointerType` distinguishes them where behavior actually needs to
 * differ. Mouse and pen input run through EXACTLY the same
 * runPointerDown/runPointerMove/runPointerUp core as before this was pointer-
 * based (unchanged behavior, just re-entered via a differently-named event);
 * touch gets its own gesture layer on top of that same core -- see
 * handleTouchPointerDown's own doc comment for why single-finger taps/drags
 * defer committing to that core by a small movement threshold (so a second
 * finger arriving to start a pinch doesn't first fire a spurious point-pick/
 * click), while two fingers drive pan+zoom directly and never reach it at
 * all. `touch-action: none` on the canvas (style.css) hands ALL gesture
 * recognition to this code -- the browser performs no scroll/pinch-zoom of
 * its own on this element.

  // undo. Without this deferral, the ordinary two-finger pinch gesture's
  // first finger would fire a spurious point-pick/selection click every time
  // before the second finger's pointerdown even arrives.
  //
  // Two fingers: pan by the midpoint's own movement and zoom (pinch) around
  // that same midpoint, every move -- never reaches runPointerDown/Move/Up
  // at all, so it can never interfere with an active command. Dropping back
  // to fewer than 2 fingers simply ends the gesture; it does not resume
  // single-touch tracking with whichever finger remains (the same
  // conservative choice most touch drawing/map apps make).
  //
  // One finger while a command is actively awaiting a point (point-picking,
  // e.g. Line's next vertex): a two-phase AIM / CONFIRM model, not a tap-or-
  // drag deferral like the plain-selection case above -- a fingertip
  // inevitably covers the very thing it's pointing at, so a touch-driven
  // point-pick previews (offset cursor, see offsetTouchCursor()) but never
  // commits on its own lift. Lifting just freezes the preview in place as
  // `pendingCommandCandidate`, staying visible so you can look at it,
